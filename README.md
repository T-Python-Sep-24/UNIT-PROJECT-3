- Project Name:
Leave Management System

- Project Description:
The Leave Management System is designed to streamline the process of employees submitting leave requests. The system ensures that leave requests are first submitted to the employee's manager for approval, and then forwarded to the HR department for final processing. This system aims to automate and simplify leave management, ensuring a smooth workflow between employees, managers, and HR.

- Features List:
    1.Employee Leave Request Submission
    2.Manager Approval Workflow
    3.HR Final Approval and Record Keeping
    4.Leave Types (e.g., sick leave, vacation leave, etc.)
    5.Leave Balance Tracking
    6.User-Friendly Interface for Employees, Managers, and HR
    7.Manager Denial Notification: If the manager rejects a request, it is sent directly back to the employee without involving HR.
    8.Conflict Detection: Prevents employees from submitting leave on the same date as an existing request.
    9.Date Selection Restriction: The end date for the leave cannot be selected before the start date, and the start date must be at least one day before the end date.
    10.Leave Conflict Visibility for Managers: When a leave request is submitted for a date that already has leave requests from other employees, the system displays a list of those employees to the manager.
